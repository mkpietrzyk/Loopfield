## Loopfield (codename Circulize). 
### My first ever entry to Ludum Dare! 


### Tools used:

* Game Engine: Unity 2019 LTS,
* Graphics: Corel DRAW X7 Student edition,
* Music (Theme): Bosca Ceoil,
* SFX: bfxr

PS: My source code is so terrible I need a flamegewehr :sweat_smile: 

### Lore

Your spacecraft has been damaged during space dogfight and you're drifting for asteroid belt. Your fighter reactor can only support plasma shielding, however it is unstable. Your shielding decreases it's radius every second before reactor can pulsate again in it's looping phase. Will you survive until the fleet found you? 

### How to play 

Point at any targets with your shield (mouse) to disintegrate them. 

* Look out for Red blocks, as they can damage your aircraft. 
* Green diamond Health Block regenerates health of your aircraft 
* Blue triangle buff blocks makes your reactor reimpulse and regenerate full shielding. 

* Your shielding ecrease radius every second for 60 seconds. After that, it regenerates.

You can destroy those block with your shields as well, but you will get less points for doing so, and no bonuses of course.

### Objective

#### Survive as long as possible (Around 5 minutes!), until Fleet(R) can find you.

#### Good luck!
